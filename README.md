# Mobile Development With Flutter

This repo is for my Mobile Development Class and should have all the files to show my work on the project.
This is my first app that I'm creating using Flutter.  Flutter utilizes the Dart programming language.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to be able to create some sort of working application for students to be able to manage their classes, schedule, and times in an all encompassing mobile app.
Features will be pushed here as I learn and hopefully it will be complete by the end of June 2021.

Thanks for joining me on this journey and I hope you enjoy my work!

[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
